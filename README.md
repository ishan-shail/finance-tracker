# 📊 Advanced Financial Analytics & Budgeting System

## Project Description
This is a fully functional, client-side financial analytics web application built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
The application helps users track income and expenses, analyze financial behavior, and visualize expense distribution using dynamic DOM manipulation without any frontend frameworks.

## Problem Statement
Students and individuals often fail to understand their financial habits due to lack of structured tracking and analysis tools.  
This project solves that problem by providing an interactive finance tracker that calculates income, expenses, balance, savings rate, and category-wise expense distribution in real time using pure JavaScript and DOM-based rendering.
